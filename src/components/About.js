                    <p>I have been very fortunate to pursue my dream as a freelance web developer.  My experience has allowed me to collaborate with some of the leading educators, influencers, and companies in the hair and beauty industry. I am quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually growing my love and skill for my profession.</p>
